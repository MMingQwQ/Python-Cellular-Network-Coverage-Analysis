# Python Programming - Cellular Network Coverage Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based program that analyzes the coverage of a cellular network provider based on data provided in a JSON file. The program processes the base stations and antenna data to calculate statistics on network coverage and provides the user with various options to view the analysis results. Developed as part of COMP 348.

## Language: Python

## Type: Individual Assignment

## Main Takeaway

- Reading and processing JSON data files to analyze network coverage.
- Implementing a menu-driven program for user interaction.
- Calculating and displaying global and base station-specific statistics.
- Working with Python libraries for file handling and data processing.

## Assignment

### Cellular Network Coverage Analysis Program

- **Objective:**
  To develop a Python program that processes cellular network data from a JSON file, providing various statistics about the base stations and their antennas, as well as coverage details.

- **Description:**
  The program reads a JSON file that contains data on base stations and antennas, including their coordinates and signal coverage. It calculates statistics on network coverage such as total base stations, number of antennas, and areas covered by one or more antennas. The program offers a menu for users to choose between displaying global statistics, base station-specific data, or checking coverage for a specific coordinate.

- **Key Features:**
  - JSON file parsing to extract base station and antenna data.
  - Calculation of global network statistics (e.g., number of antennas, coverage area).
  - Display of base station-specific statistics based on user selection.
  - Option to check coverage at a specific coordinate.
  - Error handling for invalid or missing data in the JSON file.

## IDE

- **VSCode** (1.85.2)
